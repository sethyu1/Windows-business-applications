Advanced Business Application Development
This project focuses on the development of advanced Windows business applications 
using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and multi-tier application architecture. 
The application leverages a relational database and incorporates Language Integrated Query (LINQ) 
for seamless interaction with both database data and XML files.

Key features and areas of focus include:

Multi-Tier Application Architecture: Developing robust, scalable business applications with clear separation between presentation, logic, and data access layers.
LINQ Integration: Using LINQ for querying and manipulating data, both from databases (SQL Server) and external XML files, to streamline data handling and improve code efficiency.
Multi-Threading: Implementing multi-threading concepts by creating separate threads manually and 
utilizing external devices that operate on their own threads to enhance application performance and responsiveness.
Web Application Development: Building a Web application using ASP.NET to provide dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Web Service Integration: Designing and developing a Web Service that serves as a bridge between both the Windows and Web applications, ensuring seamless communication and integration across platforms.
This project aims to provide hands-on experience in applying industry-standard technologies such as C#, 
.NET Framework, SQL Server, and ASP.NET to deliver complex, data-driven solutions. 
Additionally, the development process includes creating web services to ensure interoperability across different client environments.
